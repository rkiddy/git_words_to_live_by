A 'git-things-to-help-yourself' list. So:

- do a 'git checkout master' before you do a 'git pull upstream master'
- do not worry about automated master-merge messages in a fork
- do a 'git stash' before you pull from upstream. may not be needed but it is easy.
- do a 'git stash pop' some time after every 'git stash'
- do a 'git pull upstream master; git push <origin>' at least daily-ish
- do not keep diffs you will not want later. Clear them out.
- if you are in a branch, do not 'git checkout otherBranch'. do a 'git checkout master' first.
- if you want to store something for you do not know when, put it in a branch in
your fork and just leave it and have no stress about it. Branches do not cost money.
